<!-- Create a FormSubmit event to allow your FacilitySearchForm to pass the selected facility type to the 
FacilitySearchResults component, which queries Apex and stores the results.
Handle FormSubmit with a controller action, onFormSubmit, and pass formData.facilityTypeId from the 
controller to search, a public method on the FacilitySearchResults component. The search function uses a 
helper function, onSearch(), and controller function, doSearch(), to get the list of facilities. -->
